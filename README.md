# MongoMongoose

## All the News That's Fit to Scrape
In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

### npm packages used:
* express
* express-handlebars
* mongoose
* body-parser
* cheerio
* request
* morgan

### Deployed to Heroku
```
In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. 
mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. 
Follow these steps to get it running:

Create a Heroku app in your project directory.

Run this command in your Terminal/Bash window:
* `heroku addons:create mongolab`
* This command will add the free mLab provision to your project.
```
